# BruteLocal

**BruteLocal.ps1** is a PowerShell-based credential brute-forcing utility designed for controlled internal use within assumed-breach, red team, or systems auditing scenarios. It enables security professionals to test local account passwords in a safe, lockout-aware manner by interleaving authentication attempts across users.

> **‚ö† Disclaimer:** This script is intended for legitimate security testing and auditing by authorised personnel only. Usage against systems you do not own or have permission to test is illegal and unethical.

## ‚ú® Features

* Supports single usernames or user lists (including `DOMAIN\User` syntax)
* Batch-based password guessing with configurable pauses to avoid account lockout
* Outputs discovered credentials with optional file logging
* Supports quiet mode, verbose output, summary stats, and coloured console output
* Written in pure PowerShell 5.1 (compatible with Windows 10/11, Server 2016+)

## ‚öô Technical Details

### Logon Testing

BruteLocal uses native Windows API calls to verify credentials without spawning new processes. Specifically, it uses the `LogonUser` function from `advapi32.dll` via P/Invoke.

```csharp
[DllImport("advapi32.dll", SetLastError=true, CharSet=CharSet.Unicode)]
public static extern bool LogonUser(
    string user, string domain, string pass,
    int type, int provider, out IntPtr token);
```

* **Logon type:** `2` (Interactive)
* **Logon provider:** `0` (Default)

Successful logins return a valid token, which is released immediately using:

```powershell
[Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Release($token)
```

### Lockout Avoidance

The script interleaves attempts across users within a batch, ensuring that no single user receives more than `-g` attempts per cycle. After each batch, it sleeps for `-t` minutes to reset the lockout timer (based on `net accounts` policy).

### Token Cleanup

All successful tokens are explicitly released to avoid memory/resource leaks. No session is created or maintained.
